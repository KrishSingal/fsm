/*
Summary:
- configured so that clicking "greedy" automatically runs this algorithm (no need to click anywhere else)
- 

Questions:
- do we need to construct the adjacency list thing? What exactly is that for?
- how to make the screen tell a message to the user?
- what else does it return? return the new divisor or is that something that's just updated and doesn't need to return?

- when you've clicked firing mode and greedy, then when you unclick firing mode to update values or something, reclicking firing mode 
    makes it so greedy is also clicked again and then greedy runs when you "unclick" it
- game continues to be stuck on borrowing in chip firing mode after having run greedy
